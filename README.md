## TOP 50+ Interview questions

1. # Explain the main purpose of an operating system?
  - Operating systems exist for two main purposes.One is that it is designed to make sure a computer system performs well by managing its computational activities.
  - Another is that it provides an envirnoment for the devlopment and execution of programs.


2. # What is demand paging?
  - Demand paging is referred when not all of a process's pages are in the RAM, then the OS brings the missing(and required ) pages from the disk into the RAM.
  
  
3. # What are the advantages of a multiprocessor system?
  - with an increased number of  processors, there is considerable increase in throughput.It can also save more money because they can share resources .
  - Finally,overall reliability is increased as well. 
  
  
4. # What is a Thread?  
  - A thread is a single sequence stream within a process. They are also called lightweight processes because they have some of the properties of processes.
  - Threads are a popular way to improve the application through parallelism. 
  - For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. MS word uses multiple threads, one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs,       etc. 
  
  
5. # What is Thrashing? 
  - A situation when the performance of a computer degrades or collapses. 
  - It occurs when a system spends more time processing page faults than executing transactions.
  - While processing page faults is necessary in order to appreciate the benefits of virtual memory, thrashing has a negative effect on the system. As the page fault        rate increases, more transactions need processing from the paging device. The queue at the paging device increases, resulting in increased service time for a page        fault.
